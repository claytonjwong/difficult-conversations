## Difficult Converations are a Normal Part of Life

Breakthrough performance is going to depend on us learning to deal with conflict more effectively, leveraging it for competitive advantage.  Conflict and differing perspectives become a competitive asset, an engine for rapid learning and innovation.  Companies that nurture these communication skills as a core competence for leaders will leave their competition in the dust.

Dealing constructively with tough topics and awkward situations strengthens relationships.  We can shift from a "message delivery stance" to a "learning stance."  Only then can we understand and implement the steps of a learning converation.

## What is a Difficult Conversation?

Anything we find hard to talk about.

## 3 Conversations

All difficult converations share a common structure.  Understanding that structure is critical to improving how we handle our most challenging conversations.  The gap between what we are really thinking and what we are actually saying is part of what makes a conversation difficult.

No matter the subject, our thoughts and feelings fall into the same 3 categories:

1. "What Happened" Conversation
2. The Feelings Conversation
3. The Identity Conversation

### 1. "What Happened" Conversation

#### The Truth Assumption

**‚≠êÔ∏è This simple assumption causes endless grief: "I am right, you are wrong"**

Difficult converstaions are <u>not</u> about:
* getting the facts right
* what is true
* right and wrong
* who is right and wrong

Difficult converstaions are about:
* what is important
* what matters
* intepretation and judgement

#### The Intention Invention

* The error we make in the realm of intentions is simple but profound: we assume we know the intentions of others when we don't, and we often decide the assumed intentions are bad.
* Because our view of other's intentions (and their views of ours) are so important in difficult conversations, leaping to unfounded assumptions can be a disaster.

#### The Blame Frame

* In situations which give rise to difficult conversations, it is almost always true that what happened is the result of things *both* people did (or failed to do).
* The distinction between blame and contribution may seem subtle, but it is a distinction worth working to understand, because it will make a significant difference in our ability to handle difficult conversations.

### 2. The Feelings Conversation

**‚≠êÔ∏è Talking about feelings is a skill which can be learned.**

* Difficult conversations do not just *involve* feelings, they are at their very core *about* feelings.
  * Feelings are an integral part of the conflict
  * If feelings are the issue, what have we accomplished if we don't address them?
    * Understanding feelings, talking about feelings, managing feelings - these are amoung the greatest challenges of being human.

### 3. The Identity Conversation

**‚≠êÔ∏è Who we are and how we see ourselves**

* The identity conversation looks inward
  * Subtle and challenging
  * Before, during, and after the difficult conversation, the Identity Conversation is about what we are saying to ourselves about ourselves

## Moving Toward a Learning Conversation

üôÅ Our initial purpose for having a difficult conversation is often to prove a point, to deliver a message.

üôÇ Once we understand the challenges inherent in the 3 conversations and the mistakes we make in each, we are likely to find our purpose for having a particular conversation begins to shift:
* We no longer have a message to deliver, but rather some information to share and some questions to ask.
  * Changing our stance means inviting the other person into the conversation with us, to help us figure things out, to have a learning conversation.

## Stop Arguing About Who's Right: Explore Each Other's Stories

Why is it always the *other* person who is naive or selfish or irrational or controlling?  Why is it that we never think we are the problem?

### We Each Make Sense in Our Story of What Happened

What's often hard to see is that what the other person is saying *also* makes sense.  We each have different stories about what is going on in the world.
* Difficult conversations arise at precisely those points where important parts of our story collide with another person's story.

### Arguing Blocks Us from Exploring Each Other's Stories

Arguing inhibits our ability to learn how the other person sees the world.  Neither conclusion makes sense in the other person's story.  So we each dismiss the other's argument.  Rather than helping us understand our different views, arguing results in a battle of messages.  Rather than drawing us together, arguing pulls us apart.

### Arguing without Understanding is Unpersuasive

Arguing creates another problem in difficult conversations: it inhibits change.  *Telling* someone to change makes it less rather than more likely that they will.  This is because people almost never change without first feeling understood.
* To get anywhere in a disagreement, we need to understand they other person's story well enough to see how their conclusions make sense within it.

### Different Stories: Why We Each See the World Differently

We all have different stories about the world because we each take in different information and then intepret this information in our own unique ways.

1. We have different information
   * As each of us proceeds through life, we end up noticing some things are ignoring others
   * What we choose to notice and ignore will be different
   * We each have access to different information
   * What we notice had to do with who we are and what we care about
   * Others have access to information about themselves that we don't
2. We have different intepretations
   * Two especially important factors in how we interpret information:
     * Our past experiences
       * Every strong view we have is profoundly influenced by our past experiences
       * What we've observed in our own family
       * What we've learned throughout our life
       * Often we aren't aware of how these experiences affect our intepretation of the world.  We simply believe that this is the way things are.
     * The implicit rules we've learned about how things should and should not be done
       * Our past experiences often develop into "rules" by which we live our lives.
       * Whether we are aware of them or not, we all follow such rules, and they have a significant influence on the story we tell about what is happenening between us in a difficult conversation
         * When we are are in conflict, it helps to make our rules explicit, and encourage the other person to do the same, this greatly reduces the chance we will be caught in an accidental duel of conflicting rules
3. Our conclusions reflect self-interest
   * Our conclusions are partisan, they often reflect self-interest
   * We look for information to support our view and give that information the most favorable interpretation
     * Then we feel even more certain that our view is right
   * Our self-serving perceptions focus more on things that are consistent with what we want to believe and tend to ignore, explain away, and soon forget those which aren't
     * This tendency to develop unconcious biased perceptions is very human, and can be dangerous.  It calls for a dose of humility about the "rightness" of our story, especially when we have something important at stake

### Move from Certainty to Curiosity

There's only one way to come to understand the other person's story, and that's by being curious.  Certainty locks us out of their story; curiosity lets us in.

#### What's Our Story?

One way to shift our stance from easy certainty of feeling that we've thought about this from every possible angle is to get curious about what we don't know about ourself.
* The process by which we construct our stories about the world often happens so fast, and so automatically, that we are not even aware of all that influences our views

### Embrace Both Stories: Adopt the "And Stance"

It can be awefully hard to stay curious about another person's story when we have our own story to tell, especially if we're thinking that only one story can really be right.
* Part of the stress of staying curious can be relieved by adopting what we call the "And Stance."
  * Don't choose between the stories; embrace both.  That's the "And Stance."
  * Don't worry about accepting or rejecting the other person's story.
    * First work to understand it.  The mere act of understanding someone else's story doesn't require you to give up your own.
  * The "And Stance" is based on the assumption that the world is complex.
    * It gives us a place from which we can assert the full strength of our views and feelings without having to diminish the views and feelings of someone else
    * Beause we may have different information of different intepretations, both stories can make sense at the same time
    * The most useful question is not "Who's right?" but "Now that we really understand each other, what's a good way to manage this problem?"

#### To Move Forward, First Understand Where We Are

Wherever we want to go, understanding - imagining ourself in the other person's story - has got to be our first step.  Before we can figure out how to move forward, we need to understand where we are.

## Don't Assume They Meant It: Disentangle Intent from Impact

**‚≠êÔ∏è Intentions strongly influence our judgements of others.**

### Two Key Mistakes

#### The First Mistake: Our Assumptions About Intentions Are Often Wrong

Here's the problem: while we care deeply about other people's intentions toward us, we don't actually know what their intentions are.  We can't.  Other people's intentions exist only in their hearts and minds.  They are invisible to us.  However real and right our assumptions about other people's intentions may seem to us, they are often incomplete or just plain wrong.

##### We Assume Intentions from the Impact on Us

Our thinking is so automatic that we aren't even aware that our conclusion is only an assumption.  We are so taken in by our story about what they intended that we can't imagine how they could have intended anything else.  When we've been hurt by someone else's behavior, we assume the worst.

We attribute intentions to others all the time.  We often have to read between the lines to figure out what people really mean.

When we are acting, we know that much of the time we don't intend to annoy, offend, or upstage others.  We're wrapped up in our own worries, and are often unaware that we're having any negative impact on others.  When we're the ones acted upon, however, our story too easily slides into one about bad intentions and bad character.  Without hearing from the other person, we can't really know their intentions.

##### We Assume Bad Intentions Mean Bad Character

We easily jump from "They had bad intentions" to "they are a bad person."  We settle into judgements about their character that color our view of them and, indeed, affect not only any conversation we might have, but the entire relationship.  The worse our view of the other person's character, the easier it is to justify avoiding them or saying nasty things behind their back.

Our conclusions are often based solely on the impact of other's behavior on us, which is not a sufficient basis to be sure of someone else's intentions or character.

##### Accusing Them of Bad Intentions Creates Defensiveness

Given how frequently our assumptions are incomplete or wrong, the other person often feels not just accused, but falsely accused.  Few things are more aggravating.
* We should not be surprised that they try to defend themselves, or attack back
* The result is a mess.  No one learns anything, no one apologizes, nothing changes

**Two classical characteristics of the cycle which get well-intentioned people in trouble:**
1. Both parties think they are the victim
2. Both parties think they are acting only to defend themselves

##### Attributions Can Become Self-Fulfilling

When we think others have bad intentions toward us, if affects our behavior.  And, in turn, how we behave affects how they treat us.  Before we know it, our assumption that they have bad intentions towards us has come true.

#### The Second Mistake: Good Intentions Don't Sanitize Bad Impact

A literal focus on intentions ends up clouding the conversation.  Often we say "You intended to hurt me" when what we really mean is "You don't care enough about me."  Thi is an important distinction.
* Most of us on the receiving end make little distinction between "He wanted to hurt me" and "He didn't want to hurt me, but he didn't make me a priority.  Either way, it hurts.
* It is useful to attempt to clarify our intentions.  The question is when.  If we do it at the beginning of the conversation, we are likely doing it without fully understanding what the other person really means to express.

##### We Aggravate Hostility - Especially Between Groups

The desire to sanitize impact is especially commmon in situations involving issues of "difference," like race, gender, or sexual orientation.
* What's important is that whether or not the intention was to exclude, people *felt* excluded.  And such feelings may take time and thought on everyone's part to work through.

### Avoiding the Two Mistakes

Separating impact from intentions requires us to be aware of the automatic leap from "I was hurt" to "You intended to hurt me."  We can make this distinction by asking ourselves 3 questions:

1. **Actions:** "What did the other person actually say or do?"
2. **Impact:** "What was the impact on me?"
3. **Assumption:** "Based on this impact, what assumption am I making about what the other person intended?"

#### Hold Our Views as Hypothesis

Share the impact on us and inquire about their intentions
* We can use our answers to the previous 3 questions to begin the difficult conversation itself
  * Say what the other person did
  * Tell them what its impact on us
  * Explain our assumption about their intentions

#### Don't Pretend We Don't Have a Hypothesis

Recognize our assumptions for what they are: mere guesses subject to modification or disproof.
* When we share our assumptions about their intentions, simply be clear that we are sharing assumptions (guesses) and that we are sharing them for the purpose of testing whether they make sense to the other person

##### Some Defensiveness is Inevitable

It is best to anticipate a certain amount of defensiveness, and to be prepared to clarify what we are trying to communicate and what we are not.
* The more we can relive the other person of the need to defend themselves, the easier it becomes for them to take in what we are saying and to reflect on the complexity of their motivations.

#### Avoiding the Second Mistake: Listen for Feelings and Reflect on Our Intentions

We have a strong tendency to want to defend ourselves, however, starting there leads to trouble.
* If we start by listening and acknowledging the feelings, and then return to the question of intentions, it will make our conversation significantly easier and more constructive.

##### Be Open to Reflecting on the Complexity of Our Intentions

Understanding how we distort other's intentions, making difficult converstations even more difficult, is crucial to untangling what happened to us.

## Abandon Blame: Map the Contribution System

**üôÅ <u>Blame</u> is about <i>judging</i>**
**üôÇ <u>Contribution</u> is about <i>understanding</i>**

Focusing on blame is a bad idea because it inhibits our ability to learn what's really causing the problem and to do anything meaningful to correct it.  And because blame is often irrelevant and unfair.  The urge to blame is based, quite literally, on a misunderstanding of what has given rise to the issues between us and the other person, and on the fear of being blamed.  To often, blaming also serves as a bad proxy for talking directly about hurt feelings.

### Distinguish Blame from Contribution

The distinction between blame and contribution is not always easy to grasp, but it is essential to improving our ability to handle difficult conversations well.

### Blame is About Judging and Looks Backwards

WHen we ask the question "Who is to blame?" we are really asking three questions in one:

1. Did this person cause the problem?
2. How should this person's actions be judged against some standard of conduct?
3. How should this person be punished?

When we blame someone, we are offering them the role of "the accused," so they do what accused people do: they defend themselves any way they can.

### Contribution is About Understanding and Looks Forward

Contribution asks a related but different set of questions:

1. How did we *each* contribute to bringing about the current situation?
2. Having identified the contribution system, how can we change it?
3. What can we do about it as we go forward?

Contribution is useful when our goal is to understand what actually happened so that we can improve how we work together in the future.  Too often we deal in blame when our real goals are understanding and change.
* As we get a handle on the interactive system the two of us have created, we can see what we each need to do to avoid or alter that system in the future.

#### Contribution is Joint and Interactive

Focusing on the contributions and seeking understanding rather than judgement is critical.  When things go wrong in human relationships, everyone has contributed in some important way.
* This is not how we usually *experience* contribution
* A common distortion is to see contribution as singular
  * What has gone wrong is either entirely our fault or (more often) entirely theirs
* Almost every situation is the result of a joint contribution system
  * Focusing on only one or the other of the contributors obscures rather than illuminates that system

### The Costs of the Blame Frame

#### When Blame is the Goal, Understanding is the Casualty

The cost of blame is that learning the truth about what happened becomes more difficult.
  * Focusing on blame is a waste of time, it neither helps us understand the problem looking back, not helps us fix it going forward.

##### Blame Can Leave a Bad System Undiscovered

Removing one player in a system is sometimes warranted.  But the cost of doing so as a substitute for the hard work of examining the larger contribution system is often surprisingly high.

### The Benefits of Understanding Contribution

**‚≠êÔ∏è Contribution encourages learning and change**

Fundamentally, using the blame frame makes conversations more difficult, while understanding the contribution system makes difficult conversations easier and more likely to be productive.

#### 3 Misconceptions About Contributions

1. I should only focus on my contribution
  a) Finding our contribution doesn't in any way negate the other person's contribution.
  b) It has taken us both to get into this mess, it will probably take us both to get out of it.
2. Putting aside blame means putting aside my feelings
  a) As we and the other person look at how we each have contributed to the problem, sharing our feelings is essential
  b) the very impulse to blame is often stimulated by strong emotions which lie unexpressed
  c) Instead of focusing on blame as a proxy for our feelings, we can speak more directly about our feelings and that reduces the impulse to blame, it frees us to talk more comfortably and productively in terms of contribution
  d) we may find some relief by asking ourselves: "What feelings am I failing to express?" and "Has the other person acknowledged my feelings?"  As we explore this terrain, we may find oursleves naturally shifting from a blame frame to a contribution frame.
3. Exploring contribution means "blaming the victim"
  a) When someone blames the victim, they are suggesting that the victim "brought it on themselves," that they deserved or even wanted to be victimized.  This is often terribly unfair and painful for both the victim and others
  b) looking for joint contribution is not about blame of any kind
  c) we may not be able to change the other person's contributions, but we can often change our own
  d) By identifying what we are doing to perpetuate a situation, we learn where we have leverage to affect the system.  Simply by changing our own behavior, we gain at least some influence over the problem.

#### Finding Our Fair Share: 4 Hard-to-Spot Contributions

1. Avoiding until now
  a) One of the most common contributions to a problem, and one of the easiest to overlook, is the simple act of avoiding
2. Being unapproachable
  a) The flip side of not bringing something up is having an interpersonal style that keeps people at bay.  We contribute by being uninterested, unpredictable, short-tempered, judgemental, punitive, hypersensitive, argumentative, or unfriendly; and this becomes part of the system of avoidance between us
3. Intersections
  a) combining our two worldviews produces a system of interaction
  b) by shifting to a contribution frame, we can piece together the elements of the system that led to our fights and talk about how to handle them, only then does communication improve
  c) treating an intersection as a question of right vs. wrong leads to the death of a great many relationships
  d) so long as we each continue to see this as a matter of right vs. wrong, rather than an intersection, there is no way to avoid a train wreck.  In contrast, successful relationships are built on the knowledge that in intersections, there's no one to blame.  People are just different.  If we hope to stay together over the long haul, we will sometimes have to compromise our preferences and meet in the middle.

#### 2 Tools for Spotting Contributions

1. Role reversal
  a) Ask ourselves, "What would they say I'm contributing?"  Pretent we are the other person and answer this question in the first person.
  b) Seeing ourselves through someone else's eyes can help us understand what we're doing to feed the system
2. The observer's insight
  a) Step back and look at the problem from the perspective of a disinterested observer.  How would we describe, in a neutral, nonjudgemental way, what each person is contributing?

#### Map the Contribution System

##### What am I Contributing and What are They Contributing?

1. **Shifters** tend to see themselves as innocent victims, when something goes wrong, it's always because of what someone else did
2. **Absorbers** tend to feel responsible for everything

We may fear that being the first to own up to some contribution put us in a vulnerable position for the rest of the conversation, this is an important concern, especially if we tend to be a contribution absorber.
* Taking responsibility for our contribution up front prevents the other person from using it as a shield to avoid a discussion of their own contribution.
* In addition to taking responsibility for what we have contributed, there are things we can do to help them locate their contribution.
  * By jotting down the things that triggered us to react, we are starting to get a handle on the actions and reactions that make up the contribution system.
  * Clarify what we would have them do differently
    * Making a specific request for how the other person can change their contribution *in the service of helping us change ours* can be a powerful way of helping them understand what they are doing to create and perpetuate the problem.  And it goes to the heart of the purpose of understanding the contribution system, to see what we each need to do differently to influence and improve the situation.
    * The goal isn't to get an admission, the goal is to understand better what's happened between us, so that we can start to talk constructively about where to go next.

## Have Your Feelings (Or They Will Have You)

* üôÅ If we deny that the emotions are there, then maybe we can avoid the consequences of feeling them.
* üôÇ Feelings are too powerful to remain peacefully bottled.
  * They will be heard one way or another, whether in leaks or bursts
  * If handled indirectly or without honesty, they contaminate communication

### Feelings Matter: They Are Often at the Heart of Difficult Conversations

* Feelings let us know that we are fully alive.
* Managing feelings can be enormously challenging
  * Our failure to acknowledge and discuss feelings derails a startling number of difficult converstations
  * The ability to deal openly and well with feelings can undermine the quality and health of our relationships
* We can't have an effective conversation without talking about the primary issues as stake, and in difficult conversations, feelings are at the heart of what's wrong
  * The outcome will not leave us feeling satisfied unless we also talk about how we are feelings

### We Try to Frame Feeling Out of the Problem

* Framing feelings out of the problem is one way we cope with the dilemma of whether to raise something or avoid it
  * When we lay our feelings on the table, we run the risk of hurting others and of ruining relationships, we also put ourselves in a position to get hurt
  * By sticking to the "business at hand," we appear to reduce these risks
* The problem is that when feelings are at the heart of what's going on, they *are* the business at hand and ignoring them is nearly impossible
  * Framing the feelings out of the conversation is likely to result in outcomes that are unsatisfying for both people
  * The real problem is not dealt with, and emotions have an uncanny knack for finding their way back into the conversation, usually not in very helpful ways

#### Unexpressed Feelings Can Leak into the Conversation

Unspoken feelings can color the conversation in a number of ways:
* They alter our affect and tone of voice
* They express themselves through our body language or facial expressions
* They may take the form of long pauses or an odd and unexplained detachment
  * We may become sarcastic, aggressive, impatient, unpredictable, or defensive
* Most of us can determine when someone is distorting, manufacturing, or withholding an emotion
  * If clogged, our emotional pipes leak
* Unexpressed feelings can create so much tension that we disengage
  * We choose not to work with a particular colleague because we have so many unresolved feelings about them

#### Unexpressed Feelings Can Burst into the Conversation

The problem is not that we are unable to express our feelings, but that we are unable not to.
* We get angry and show it in ways that are embarrassing or destructive
* We cry or explode when we would rather act composed and capable
  * We don't cry or lose our temper because we express our feelings too often, but because we express them too rarely

#### Unexpressed Feelings Make It Difficult to Listen

The two hardest and most important communication tasks in difficult conversations are expressing feelings and listening.
* When we are having a hard time listening, it is paradoxically because we don't know how ot express ourselves well.
  * Unexpressed feelings can block the ability to listen
  * It's hard to hear someone else when we are feeling unheard, even if the reason we feel unheard is that we have chosen not to share
  * Our listening ability often increases remarkably once we have expressed our own strong feelings

### A Way Out of the Feelings Bind

**This is the way out of the feelings bind:** If we are able to share feelings with skill, we can avoid many of the potential costs associated with expressing feelings and even reap some unexpected benefits.
1. we need to sort out what our feelings are
2. we need to negotiate with our feelings
3. we need to share our actual feelings, not attributions or judgements about the other person

### Finding Our Feelings: Learn Where Feelings Hide

**‚≠êÔ∏è We often don't know how we feel**
* Before we can get to where we're going, we need to know where we are
* When it comes to understanding our emotions, most of us are lost
* Recognizing feelings is challenging
  * Feelings are very good at disguising themselves as emotions we are better able to handle
  * Feelings transform themselves into judgements, accusations, and attributions

#### Explore Your Emotional Footprint

As we grow up, each of us develops a characteristic "emotional footprint" whose shape is determined by which feelings we believe are okay to have and express and which are not.
* Our emotional footprint will be different in different relationships
  * Exploring the contours of our footprint across a variety of relationships an be extremely helpful in raising our awareness of what we are feeling and why

##### Accept That Feelings Are Normal and Natural

One assumption many of us incorporate into our footprint is the assumption that there is something inherently wrong with having feelings
* merely *having* feelings, any feelings, is enough to cause us shame

##### Recognize That Good People Can Have Bad Feelings

Another assumption many of us incorporate into our footprint is that there are certain emotions "good people" shoudl never feel
* Everyone feels and experiences: anger, sadness, failure
* Denying feelings can serve a deeper psychological function
  * In the face of overwhelming anxiety, fear, loss, or trauma, removing ourself from our feelings can help us cope with daily life
  * Unacknowledged feelings adversely affect communiction
  * As we allow ourselves to feel things that were there all along and begin to deal with the underlying causes of those feelings, our interactions with others, including difficult conversations, will become increasingly easy to handle

##### Learn that Our Feelings Are as Important as Theirs

* There are several reasons why we may choose to honor others feelings even when it means dishonoring our own
  * The implicit rule we are following is that we should put other people's happiness before our own
  * When we are more concerned about others' feelings than our own, we teach others to ignore our feelings
  * One of the reasons we don't raise issues is that we don't want to jeopardize the relationship
    * But by *not* raising it, the resentment we feel will grow and slowly erode the relationship anyway

##### Find the Bundle of Feelings Behind the Simple Labels

* In many situations, we are blinded to the complexity of our feelings by one strong feeling that trumps all the others
  * Simply becoming familiar with the spectrum of difficult-to-find feelings may trigger a flash of recognition for you

##### Find the Feelings Lurking Under Attributions, Judgements, and Accusations

* One danger of making attributions about the intentions of others is that it can lead to defensiveness and misunderstandings
  * The difference between judgements about others and statements of our own feelings is sometimes difficult to see
    * Judgements *feel* like feelings when we are saying them
    * While they may feel similar, there is a vast difference between "You are thoughtless and self-absorbed" and "I feel hurt, confused, and embarrased"
      * Finding feelings that are lurking around and under angry attributions and judgements is a key step in bringing feelings into a conversation effectively

##### Use the Urge to Blame as a Clue fo Find Important Feelings

* A common complaint when we encourage people to talk in term of joint contribtion rather than blame is that the ensuing conversation leaves us feeling unsatisfied
  * What is satisfying though, is not the failure to express blame, but the failure to express feelings
  * The urge to blame arises when the contribution system is explored in a feelings vaccuum
  * When we can't seem to get past needing to say, "Admit it!  This was your fault!" we should recognize that as an important clue that we are sitting on unexpressed emotions
    * Once those feelings are expressed, the urge to blame recedes

### Don't Treat Feelings as Gospel: Negotiate with Them

* Our feelings are based on our perceptions and our perceptions are negotiable
  * As we see the world in new ways, our feelings shift accordingly
  * What does it mean to negotiate with our feelings?
    * Fundamentally, it involves a recognition that our feelings are formed in response to our thoughts
      * It's the story we tell ourself about what's happening
      * In any given situation, our feelings follow our thoughts
* We need to examine our own story
  * What is the story we are telling ourselves that is giving rise to how we feel?
  * What is our story missing?
  * What might the other person's story be?
    * Almost always, an increased awareness of the other person's story changes how we feel
* We need to explore our assumptions about the other person's intentions
  * To what extent are our feelings based on an untested assumption about their intentions?
  * How does our view of their intentions affect how we feel?
* We should consider the contribution system
  * Are we able to see our own contribution to the problem?
* It is enough to raise these questions and observe feelings from multiple perspectives
  * If we are thoughtful, honest, and approach these questions openly with a spirit of fairness, our feelings being to shift
  * When we consider a situation from another point of view, focusing not on blame, but on contributions, our perception of the situation becomes more complex, as does our feelings

### Don't Vent: Describe Feelings Carefully

**‚≠êÔ∏è Sharing feelings well and clearly requires thoughtfulness**

* Frame feelings back into the problem
  * Expressing feelings well involves simply remembering that they're important
  * Almost every difficult conversation will involve strong feelings
  * If feelings are the real issue, then feelings should be addressed
* Express the full spectrum of our feelings
  * By putting the broaded spectrum of our feelings into the conversation, we change the nature of the conversation
    * This leads to greater understanding and engagement
    * This points the way toward different patterns of interacting that are more mutally supportive
* Don't evaluate, just share
  * Getting everyone's feelings on the table, heard and acknowledged, is essential before we can begin to sort through them
  * Premature evaluation of whether feelings are legitimate will undermind their expression and the relationship
* Express our feelings without judging, attributing, or blaming
  * Talking successfully about feelings requires us to be scrupulous about taking the judgements, attributions, and statements of blame out of what we are saying and putting the statement of feeling in
  * State the pure feelings first and explore the joint contribution (not blame) later
* Don't monopolize, both sides can have strong feelings at the same time
  * If we have strong feelings, it's quite likely that the other person does too
    * Just as our own ambivalent feelings don't cancel each other out, their feelings don't cancel ours, or vice versa
    * What's important is to get both parties' strong and perhaps conflicting emotions into the conversation
* An easy reminder: Say "I feel..."
  * These words can have a powerful effect on our listener
  * Beginning with "I feel..." is a simple act that carries with it extraordinary benefits
    * It keeps the focus on feelings and makes clear that we are speaking only from our own perspective
    * It avoids the translation trap of judging or accusing

### The Importance of Acknowledgement

Describing feelings is an important first step along the road toward getting things resolved, but we can't leap from there directly into problem-solving.
* Each side must have their feelings *acknowledged* before we can even start problem solving
  * Acknowledgement cannot be skipped
  * Acknowledgement of feelings is crucial in any relationship
* What does it mean to acknowledge someone's feelings?
  * Letting the other person know that what they have said has made an impression on us, that their feelings matter to us, and that we are working to understand them
  * Let them know we thinking understanding their perspective is important and that we are trying to do so
* Before moving onto problem-solving, we have a responsibility to ourself and to the other person to ensure that they appreciate the importance of this topic to us
  * We truly understand each other's feelings and value having shared them

## Ground Your Identity: Ask Ourself What's at Stake

Difficult convesations have the potential to disrupt our sense of who we are in the world, or to highlight what we hope we are but fear we are not.  The conversation poses a threat to our identity (the story we tell ourselves about ourselves) and having our identity threatened can be profoundly disturbing.

### Three Core Identities

Three identity issues seem particularly common, and often underlie what concerns us most during difficult conversations:

1. Am I competent?
2. Am I a good person?
3. Am I worthy of love?

### Vulnerable Identities: The All-or-Nothing Syndrome

The biggest factor that contributes to a vulnerable identity is "all-or-nothing" thinking: I'm either competent or incompetent, good or evil, worthy of love or not.
* The primary peril of all-or-nothing thinking is that it leaves our identity extremely unstable, making us hypersensitive to feedback
  * All-or-nothing thinking gives ourselves 2 choices:
    * Denial: Either we try to deny the information that is inconsistent with our self-image
    * Exaggeration: Or we do the opposite, we take in the information in a way that exaggerates its importance to a crippling degree

#### Denial

If we're going to engage in difficult conversations, or in life for that matter, we're going to come up against information about ourselves that we find unpleasant.
* Denial requires a huge amount of psychic energy, and sooner or later the story we're telling ourselves is going to become untenable.

#### Exaggeration

When we exaggerate, we act as if the other person's feedback is the *only* information we have about ourselves.

### Ground Our Identity

1. We need to become familiar with those identity issues that are important to us, so we can spot them during a conversation
2. We need to learn to integrate new information into our identity in ways that are healthy, a step that requires us to let go of all-or-nothing thinking

#### Step 1: Become Aware of Our Identity Issues

Often during a difficult conversation we are not even aware that our identity is implicated.  The connection to our identity is not obvious.
* We each have our own particular sensitivities.  To become more familiar with ours, observe whether there are patterns to what tends to knock us off balance during difficult conversations
  * Then ask ourself why:
    * What about our identity feels at risk?
    * What does this mean to you?
    * How would it feel if what you fear were true?

#### Step 2: Complexify Our Identity (Adopt the "And Stance")

**‚≠êÔ∏è A self-image that allows for complexity is healthy and robust; it provides a sturdy foundation on which to stand**

We can begin to complexify our self-image.  This means moving away from the false choice between "I am perfect" and "I am worthless," and trying to get as clear a picture as we can about what is actually true about us.
* All-or-nothing identities oversimplify the world
  * No one is *always* anything
* We each exhibit a constellation of qualities, positive and negative, and constantly grapple with how to respond to the complicated situations life presents.
* We don't always respond as competently or compassionately as we'd like

### Three Things to Accept About Ourself

As we move away from an all-or-nothing identity and toward a more complex view of who we are, we will notice that it is easier to accept certain parts of ourself that have given us trouble in the past.

There are three characteristics that are particularly important to be able to accept about ourself in difficult conversations.  The more easily we can admit to our own mistakes, our own mixed intentions, and our own contributions to the problem, the more balanced we will feel during the conversation, and the higher the chances it will go well.

#### 1. We Will Make Mistakes

**‚≠êÔ∏è One reason people are reluctant to admit mistakes is that they fear being seen as weak or incompetent.  Yet often, generally competent people who take the possibility of mistakes in stride are seen as confident, secure, and "big enough" not to have to be perfect, whereas those who resist acknowledging even the possibility of a mistake are seen as insecure and *lacking* confidence.  No one is fooled.**

If we can't admit to ourself that we somtimes make mistakes, we will find it more difficult to understand and accept legitimate aspects of the other person's story about what is going on.
* When we hold ourself to an all-or-nothing standard, even a small mistake can seem catastrophic and almost impossible to admit.
  * We won't be able to engage in a meaningful learning conversation; and if we can't do that, we are likely to make the same mistakes again

#### 2. Our Intentions are Complex

We know that our past behavior was not always motivated by good intentions.
* By being honest with our complex motivations, we can be more genuine and admit our shortcomings

#### 3. We Have Contributed to the Problem

We can assess and take responsibility for what we've contributed to the problem.

### During the Conversation, Learn to Regain Balance

Four things we can do before and during a difficult conversation to help ourself maintain and regain our balance include:

1. letting go of trying to control their reaction
2. preparing for their response
3. imaginging the future to gain perspective
4. taking a break

#### 1. Let Go of trying to Control Their Reaction

We may hold as one of our primary goals getting through the conversation without the other person having a "bad" reaction.
* Yet holding this as a *purpose* in the conversation leads to trouble.
  * Just as we can't change another person, we can't control their reaction and we shouldn't try
  * Trying to sooth over or stifle the other person's reaction will make things worse, not better
    * The message the other person is lifely to hear is "I don't understand how you feel" or worse, "You're not allowed to be upset by this."
* Rather than trying to control the other person's reaction, adopt the "And Stance"
  * Giving them space to feel however they are feeling and letting them know their feelings make sense and are okay to feel.
  * Learning that we can't control the other person's reaction, and that it can be destructive to try, can be incredibly liberating
    * We will feel free from the desparate need for their reaction to go one certain way

#### 2. Prepare for Their Response

Instead of trying to control the other person's reaction, *prepare* for it.
* Focus on what we can learn about how the other person might respond
  * Are they likely to cry?
  * Sulk and withdraw?
  * Pretend everything is fine?
  * Attack or reject us?
* The more prepare we are for how the other person might react, the less surprised we will be.
  * If we've already considered the identity implications of how they might react, we are far less likely to be knocked off balance in the moment

#### 3. Imaginging the Future

Sometimes projecting ourself into our own future can help us feel better about what's happening now with the reassurance that eventually we will feel better, and that someday it may not seem so important.
* Thinking of our future self looking back can also give us some direction
  * If we are in the midst of a particularly painful time, think about what it will feel like to look back on this period in our life from thirty years hence.

#### 4. Take a Break

* Check for distortions
* Check for denials
* Check for exaggerations

### Their Identity is Also Implicated

When we are wrapped up in our own Identity Conversation it can be difficult to remember that the other person may be grappling with identity issues of their own.
* Often difficult conversations are wrapped up in both people reacting to what the conversation seems to be saying about them.

### Find the Courage to Ask for Help

For many of us, that's not easy.  Our Identity Conversation tells us loud and clear that asking for help is not okay, that it is shameful or weak and creates burdens for others.
* If someone you loved were in the situation we find ourself in, would we think it was okay for *them* to ask for help?
  * Why should we be held to a different standard?

## What's Our Purpose?  When to Raise It and When to Let Go

### Work Through the Three Conversations

Get a better handle on our feelings, key identity issues, and possible distortions or gaps in our perceptions.  Think clearly about what we do know (our own feelings, our own experiences, and story, our identity issues), and what we don't know (their intentions, their perspective, or feelings).
* This approach will help us become more aware of the process of communication and gain insight into what's making our conversations difficult.

### Three Kinds of Conversations That Don't Make Sense

#### Is the Real Conflict Inside Us?

Sometimes what's difficult about the situation has more to do with what's going on inside us than what's going on between us an the other person.

#### Is There a Better Way to Address the Issue Than Talking About It?

As we sort out our feelings or identify our contribution to a situation it may become clear that what's called for is not a conversation about the interaction, but a change in our behavior.  Sometimes actions are better than words.

#### Do We Have Purposes That Make Sense?

We find ourselves in the middle of the conversation, and neither person is quite sure what the point is or what a good outcome would look li56ke.
* If our purposes are off-base, then we've choosen a destination that is impossible to reach

### Remember We Can't Change Other People

We can't change someone else's mind or force them to change their behavior.
* The paradox is that trying to change someone rarely results in change
  * Others are more likely to change if they think we understand them and if they feel heard and respected
  * They are more likely to change if they feel free *not* to

### Don't Focus on Short-Term Relief at Long-Term Cost

Take time investing in the relationship in trying to work on figuring out why things are been so difficult.

#### Don't Hit and Run

**‚≠êÔ∏è If hit-and-run is all we can muster, it's better not to raise the issue at all**

Short passive-aggressive comments and venting may offer short-term relief at long-term cost.
* While our comments may help us feel a bit better temporarily ("At least I've said something"), they make the other person defensive and frustrated, which is unlikely to produce the kind of change we had in mind.
* If we're going to talk, then talk.  Really talk.  And if we're going to talk, we can't do it on the fly, we have to plan a time to talk.  We have to be explicit about wanting ten minutes or an hour to discuss something that is important to us.

### Letting Go

What we do know is that letting go usually takes time, and that it is rarely a simple journey.  It's not easy to find a place where we can set free the pain, or shame, we carry from our experiences.  A place where we can tell the story differently in our head, where we can relinquish the role of victim or villain, and give ourself and the other person roles that are more complex and liberating.  A place where we can accept ourself for who we've been and who we are.

#### It's not My Responsibility to Make Things Better; It's My Responsibility to Do My Best

We cannot always make a relationship more comfortable or more nourishing or more intimate or more durable.  The best we can do is try.
* Rather than continue to fight, it my be easier to accept others as their imperfect selves

#### The Conflict Is Not Who I Am

An important barrier to letting go occurs when we integrate the conflict into our sense of who we are.  We define ourselves in relation to our conflict with others.
* Such dynamics play an important part in ethnic conflict.  Our sense of who we are as a community is often defined in terms of who we are *not*, who we are against, and what hardships we've endured.  Tragically, we can feel threatened by the prospect of reconciliation, because it can rob us not only of our role, but also of our communal identity
  * If we find ourselve being swalled up by a conflect, if we begin to see our very identity as tied to the fight, try to take a step back and remember why we are fighting.  We are fightign for what is right and fair, not because we need the conflict to survive

#### Letting Go Doesn't Mean We No Longer Care

It is powerful being able to let go of anger while still holding on to love and memories.  We can't and don't want to forget what's happened in the past.
* Letting go of emotions and identity issues wrapped up in a difficult conversation can be one of the most challenging things we do.
  * Difficult conversations operate at the core of our being, where the people and the principles we care about most intersect with our self-image and self-esteem.
  * Letting go, at heart, is about how to handle with skill and grace *not* having a difficult conversation

### If We Raise It: Three Purposes That Work

The gold standard here is working for mutual understanding.  Not mutual agreement, necessarily, but a better understanding of each of our stories, so that we can make informed decisions (alone or together) about what to do next.

1. Learn their story
2. Express our views and feelings
3. Problem solving together

#### Stance and Purpose Go Hand in Hand

These three purposes accomodate the fact that we and the other person see the world differently, that we each have powerful feelings about what is going on, and that we each have our own identity issues to work through.  Each of us, in short, has our own story.  We need purposes that can reckon with this reality.

## Getting Started: Begin from the Third Story

The most stressful moment of a difficult conversation is often the beginning.  We may become angry or distraught or we may discover that we don't want to talk at all.
* What we say at the outset can put us squarely on the road toward understanding and problem-solving.
* There are techniques we can learn for how to take advantage of the opportunity the beginning presents, and simple principles for understanding why our usual approaches so often do awry.

### Why Our Typical Openings Don't Help

#### We Begin Inside Our Own Story

We describe the problem from our own perspective and, in doing so, trigger just the kinds of reactions we hope to avoid.
* If they agreed with our story, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation in the first place.
* Our story sends up flares, warning them to defend themselves or to counterattach

#### We Trigger Their Identity Conversation from the Start

We trigger the other person's Identity Conversation from the outset, and there's no room in our agenda for their story.
* It's natural that they would reject our version and want to get their own on the table
* By leaving their story out, we implicity set up a trade-off between their version of events and our version, between our feelings and theirs

### Step One: Begin from the Third Story

#### Think Like a Mediator

One of the most helpful tools a mediator has is the ability to identify this invisble Third Story.  This means describing the problem between the parties in a way that rings true for both sides simultaneously.
* The trick is being able to get two people with different stories to sign on to the same description of what is going on.

#### Not Right or Wrong, Not Better or Worse - Just Different

The key is learning to describe the gap or difference between our story and the other person's story.  Whatever else we may think and feel, we can at least agree that we and the other person see things differently.

##### The Third Story

Removes judgement from the description, and instead describes the problem as a *difference*.
* The third story simply captures the difference
  * That's what allows both sides to buy into the same description of the problem: each feels that their story is acknowledged as a legitimate part of the discussion.
* We can begin from the Third Story by saying, "My sense is that we see this situation differently.  I'd like to share how I'm seeing it, and learn more about how you're seeing it."
  * Most conversations can be initiated from the Third Story to include both perspectives and invite joint exploration.
  * Stepping out of our story doesn't mean giving up our point of view.
    * Our purpose in opening the conversation is to invite the other person into a joint exploration.
    * In the course of that exploration, we will spend time in each side's perspective, and then come back to adjust our own views based on what we've learned and what we've shared.
  * Keeping communication open and understanding feelings and perspectives involved sends an important message that even when we disagree, we care about each other.

### Step Two: Extend an Invitation

I want to propose mutual understanding and problem-solving as purposes, check to see if this makes sense to you, and invite you to join me in a conversation.

#### Describe Our Purposes

Letting them know up front that our goal for the discussion is to understand their perspective better, share our own, and talk about how to go forward together makes the conversation significantly less mysterious and threatening.

#### Invite, Don't Impose

Our offer should be open to modification by the other person.
* Think of the hoal rather as "offering and discussing a possible description and purpose" for our conversation.
* The task of describing the problem and of setting purposes is itself a joint task

#### Make Them a Partner in Figuring It Out

We need to side-step the temptation to cast them as "the problem," or in an unappealing light, since this will trigger their Identity Conversation and stop the conversation cold.
* If accepting our invitation requires the other person to acknowledge that they are naive, callous, manipulative, or in any other way unsavory or inadequate, they are substantially less likely to accept it.
* The role we offer must be genuine, recasting them into a more attractive role requires recognizing that if we are going to gain a more complete picture of what's going on, and make any real progress, we need their help.
* Sometimes the most genuine thing we can do is share our internal struggle to cast them in a more positive role.
  * We can say something like, "They story I'm telling my head about what is going on is that you are being inconsiderate.  At some level I know that's unfair to you, and I need you to help me put things in a better perspective.  I need your to help me understand where you are coming from on this."
    * It's honest and, at the same time, offers them a role of "someone who can help us get our perspective back."

### A Map for Going Forward: Third Story, Their Story, Your Story

* We can talk about the past experiences that have led each of us to see the current situtation the way we do
* We can ask about the other person's intentions, and share the impact of their behavior on us
* We can empathize with how they might be feeling

## Learning: Listen from the Inside Out

We have a deep desire to feel heard, and to know that others care enough to listen.
* Listening well is one of the most powerful skills we can bring to a difficult conversation.
  * It helps us understand the other person
    * learning about the other person (they are important to us)
  * It helps the other person understand us

### Listening to Them Helps Them Listen to You

One of the most common complaints we hear from people engaged in difficult conversations is that the other person won't listen.
* Paradoxically, we must listen to them first
* The reason the other person is not listening is because they don't feel heard
  * They aren't listening to us for the same reason we aren't listening to them
    * If the block to their listening is that they don't feel heard, then the way to remove that block is by helping them feel heard, by bending over backwards to listen to what they have to say, and by demonstrating that we understand what they are saying and how they are feeling.
    * Listen for feelings, like frustration or pride or fear, and acknowledge those feelings

### The Stance of Curiosity: How to Listen from the Inside Out

**‚≠êÔ∏è We can shift our stance from "I understand" to "Help me understand."**

#### Forget Words, Focus on Authenticity

People "read" not only our words and posture, but what's going on inside of us.
* If our "stance" isn't genuine, the words won't matter.
* What will be communicated is whether we are genuinely curious and care about the other person
  * If our intentions are false, no amount of careful wording or good posture will help
  * If our intentions are good, even clumsy language won't hinder us
* Listening is powerful and effective when it is authentic
  * Authenticity means that we are listening because we are curious and because we care, not just because we are supposed to
    * ‚≠êÔ∏è **Are you curious? Do you care?**

#### The Commentator in Our Head: Become More Aware of Our Internal Voice

We can tell what's going on inside ourselves by listening to ourselves.
* Finding and paying attention to our own internal voice, what we are thinking but not saying, is the crucial first step in overcoming the biggest barrier to inauthentic listening
* Left unattended, that voice blocks good listening
  * To the extend we are listening to our own internal voice, we are at best half-listening to the other person
* We can turn up our internal voice and get to know the kinds of things it says
  * When we are fully aware of our own thoughts, we can begin to manage them and focus on the other person

#### Managing Our Internal Voice

**‚≠êÔ∏èManaging our internal voice is not easy, especially at first; but it is at the heart of good listening**
* üôÅ When our internal voice says "I know what this is all about," that's the end of curiosity.
* Remind ourselves that if we think we already understand how someone else feels or what they are trying to say, it is a delusion.
  * There is always more to learn
  * Remind ourself of the depth, complexities, contradictions, and nuances that make up the stories of each of our lives

### Three Skills

In addition to the stance of curiosity, there are three primary skills that good listeners employ:

1. Inquiry,
2. Paraphrasing, and
3. Acknowledgement

#### Skill One: Inquiry

We can tell whether a question will help the conversation or hurt it by thinking about why we asked it.
* The only good answer is "To learn."

##### Don't Make Statements Disguised as Questions

If we don't have a question, don't ask a question.
* Never dress up an assertion as a question
  * Disguised assertions are either about feelings or about requests
    * Sharing our feelings and making requests are two things that many of us have difficulty doing directly because they make us feel vulnerable
      * Turning what we have to say into an attack, a sarcastic question can feel safer, but this safety is an illusion, and we lose more than we gain
        * Why? Because instead of hearing the underlying feeling or request, the other person focuses on the sarcasm and the attack
        * The real message doesn't get through because they are distracted by the need to defend themselves
* Doing so creates confusion and resentment because such questions are inevitably heard as sarcastic and sometimes mean-spirited

##### Don't Use Questions to Cross-Examine

To use the ideas in these questions constructively, pull out the statements embedded in the questions and express them, but not as facts.
* Rather than asserting them as true, share them as open questions or perceptions, and ask for the other person's reaction
* Rather than assuming that this is an argument they have ignored, assume that they *have* thought about it and have reason to tell a different story

##### Ask Open-Ended Questions

Open-ended questions are questions that give the other person broad latitude in how to answer.
* They elicit more information that yes/no questions or offering menus
* Typical open-ended questions are varations on:
  * "Tell me more"
  * "Help me understand better"

##### Ask for More Concrete Information

To understand where the other person's conclusions came from and enrich our understanding of what they envision going forward, it helps to ask them to be more explicit about their reasoning and their vision.

##### Ask Questions About the Three Conversations

* Can you say a little more about how you see things?
* What information might you have that I don't?
* How do you see it differently?
* What impact have my actions had on you?
* Can you say a little more about why you think this is my fault?
* Were you reacting to something I did?
* How are you feeling about all of this?
* Say more about why this is important to you.
* What would it mean to you if that happened?

##### Make It Safe for Them to Not Answer

It's better to make our questions an invitation rather than a demand and to make that clear.
* The difference is that an invitation can be declined without penalty
  * This offers a greater sense of safety
  * If the other person declines to respond and our reaction makes that okay, then we build trust between us
    * Giving them a choice of whether to answer increases the chance that they will respond and respond honestly
    * Knowing that it's their choice underscores our caring intent and frees them to think about the question

#### Skill Two: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when we express to the other person, in our own words, our understanding of what they are saying.

##### Check Our Understanding

Paraphrasing gives us a chance to check our understanding.
* Difficult conversations are made harder when an important misunderstanding exists
  * Such misunderstandings are more common than we imagine

##### Show That We've Heard

Paraphrasing lets the other person know they've been heard.
* If we notice the other person is saying the same thing over and over again, take that as a signal that we need to paraphrase more
* Once they feel heard, they are significantly more likely to listen to us

#### Skill Three: Acknowledge Their Feelings

Feelings crave acknowledgement.
* Unless they get acknowledgement they need, feelings will cause trouble in the conversation

##### Ask the Invisible Questions

Why is acknowledgement so important?
* Because attached to each expression of feelings is a set of invisible questions:
  * "Are my feelings okay?"
  * "Do you understand my feelings?"
  * "Do you care about my feelings?"
* Taking time to acknowledge the other person's feelings say loud and clear that the answer to each question is "yes."

##### Order Matter: Acknowledge Before Problem-Solving

Often people need some acknowledgement of feelings before they can move on to the "What Happened?" Conversation.

###### Acknowledging is Not Agreeing

It is useful to distinguish between the Feelings Conversation and the "What Happened?" Converstation.
* While we may not agree with the substance of what the other person is saying, we can still acknowledge the importance of their feelings
* It requires thought to make these kinds of distinctions, but it can help immensely.
  * Too often we assume that we either have to agree or disagree with the other person
  * We can acknowledge the power and importance of the feelings, while disagreeing with the substance of what is being said

### Empathy Is a Journey, Not a Destination

The deepest form of understanding another person is empathy.
* As an empathetic listener, we are on a journey with a direction but no destination.
  * We will never "arrive"
  * Good listening is profoundly communicative
  * Struggling to understand communicates the most positive message of all
