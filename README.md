## Difficult Converations are a Normal Part of Life

Breakthrough performance is going to depend on us learning to deal with conflict more effectively, leveraging it for competitive advantage.  Conflict and differing perspectives become a competitive asset, an engine for rapid learning and innovation.  Companies that nurture these communication skills as a core competence for leaders will leave their competition in the dust.

Dealing constructively with tough topics and awkward situations strengthens relationships.  We can shift from a "message delivery stance" to a "learning stance."  Only then can we understand and implement the steps of a learning converation.

## What is a Difficult Conversation?

Anything we find hard to talk about.

## 3 Conversations

All difficult converations share a common structure.  Understanding that structure is critical to improving how we handle our most challenging conversations.  The gap between what we are really thinking and what we are actually saying is part of what makes a conversation difficult.

No matter the subject, our thoughts and feelings fall into the same 3 categories:

1. "What Happened" Conversation
2. The Feelings Conversation
3. The Identity Conversation

### 1. "What Happened" Conversation

#### The Truth Assumption

**‚≠êÔ∏è This simple assumption causes endless grief: "I am right, you are wrong"**

Difficult converstaions are <u>not</u> about:
* getting the facts right
* what is true
* right and wrong
* who is right and wrong

Difficult converstaions are about:
* what is important
* what matters
* intepretation and judgement

#### The Intention Invention

* The error we make in the realm of intentions is simple but profound: we assume we know the intentions of others when we don't, and we often decide the assumed intentions are bad.
* Because our view of other's intentions (and their views of ours) are so important in difficult conversations, leaping to unfounded assumptions can be a disaster.

#### The Blame Frame

* In situations which give rise to difficult conversations, it is almost always true that what happened is the result of things *both* people did (or failed to do).
* The distinction between blame and contribution may seem subtle, but it is a distinction worth working to understand, because it will make a significant difference in our ability to handle difficult conversations.

### 2. The Feelings Conversation

**‚≠êÔ∏è Talking about feelings is a skill which can be learned.**

* Difficult conversations do not just *involve* feelings, they are at their very core *about* feelings.
  * Feelings are an integral part of the conflict
  * If feelings are the issue, what have we accomplished if we don't address them?
    * Understanding feelings, talking about feelings, managing feelings - these are amoung the greatest challenges of being human.

### 3. The Identity Conversation

**‚≠êÔ∏è Who we are and how we see ourselves**

* The identity conversation looks inward
  * Subtle and challenging
  * Before, during, and after the difficult conversation, the Identity Conversation is about what we are saying to ourselves about ourselves

## Moving Toward a Learning Conversation

üôÅ Our initial purpose for having a difficult conversation is often to prove a point, to deliver a message.

üôÇ Once we understand the challenges inherent in the 3 conversations and the mistakes we make in each, we are likely to find our purpose for having a particular conversation begins to shift:
* We no longer have a message to deliver, but rather some information to share and some questions to ask.
  * Changing our stance means inviting the other person into the conversation with us, to help us figure things out, to have a learning conversation.
