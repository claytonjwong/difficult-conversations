## Difficult Converations are a Normal Part of Life

Breakthrough performance is going to depend on us learning to deal with conflict more effectively, leveraging it for competitive advantage.  Conflict and differing perspectives become a competitive asset, an engine for rapid learning and innovation.  Companies that nurture these communication skills as a core competence for leaders will leave their competition in the dust.

Dealing constructively with tough topics and awkward situations strengthens relationships.  We can shift from a "message delivery stance" to a "learning stance."  Only then can we understand and implement the steps of a learning converation.

## What is a Difficult Conversation?

Anything we find hard to talk about.

## 3 Conversations

All difficult converations share a common structure.  Understanding that structure is critical to improving how we handle our most challenging conversations.  The gap between what we are really thinking and what we are actually saying is part of what makes a conversation difficult.

No matter the subject, our thoughts and feelings fall into the same 3 categories:

1. "What Happened" Conversation
2. The Feelings Conversation
3. The Identity Conversation

### 1. "What Happened" Conversation

#### The Truth Assumption

**‚≠êÔ∏è This simple assumption causes endless grief: "I am right, you are wrong"**

Difficult converstaions are <u>not</u> about:
* getting the facts right
* what is true
* right and wrong
* who is right and wrong

Difficult converstaions are about:
* what is important
* what matters
* intepretation and judgement

#### The Intention Invention

* The error we make in the realm of intentions is simple but profound: we assume we know the intentions of others when we don't, and we often decide the assumed intentions are bad.
* Because our view of other's intentions (and their views of ours) are so important in difficult conversations, leaping to unfounded assumptions can be a disaster.

#### The Blame Frame

* In situations which give rise to difficult conversations, it is almost always true that what happened is the result of things *both* people did (or failed to do).
* The distinction between blame and contribution may seem subtle, but it is a distinction worth working to understand, because it will make a significant difference in our ability to handle difficult conversations.

### 2. The Feelings Conversation

**‚≠êÔ∏è Talking about feelings is a skill which can be learned.**

* Difficult conversations do not just *involve* feelings, they are at their very core *about* feelings.
  * Feelings are an integral part of the conflict
  * If feelings are the issue, what have we accomplished if we don't address them?
    * Understanding feelings, talking about feelings, managing feelings - these are amoung the greatest challenges of being human.

### 3. The Identity Conversation

**‚≠êÔ∏è Who we are and how we see ourselves**

* The identity conversation looks inward
  * Subtle and challenging
  * Before, during, and after the difficult conversation, the Identity Conversation is about what we are saying to ourselves about ourselves

## Moving Toward a Learning Conversation

üôÅ Our initial purpose for having a difficult conversation is often to prove a point, to deliver a message.

üôÇ Once we understand the challenges inherent in the 3 conversations and the mistakes we make in each, we are likely to find our purpose for having a particular conversation begins to shift:
* We no longer have a message to deliver, but rather some information to share and some questions to ask.
  * Changing our stance means inviting the other person into the conversation with us, to help us figure things out, to have a learning conversation.

## Stop Arguing About Who's Right: Explore Each Other's Stories

Why is it always the *other* person who is naive or selfish or irrational or controlling?  Why is it that we never think we are the problem?

### We Each Make Sense in Our Story of What Happened

What's often hard to see is that what the other person is saying *also* makes sense.  We each have different stories about what is going on in the world.
* Difficult conversations arise at precisely those points where important parts of our story collide with another person's story.

### Arguing Blocks Us from Exploring Each Other's Stories

Arguing inhibits our ability to learn how the other person sees the world.  Neither conclusion makes sense in the other person's story.  So we each dismiss the other's argument.  Rather than helping us understand our different views, arguing results in a battle of messages.  Rather than drawing us together, arguing pulls us apart.

### Arguing without Understanding is Unpersuasive

Arguing creates another problem in difficult conversations: it inhibits change.  *Telling* someone to change makes it less rather than more likely that they will.  This is because people almost never change without first feeling understood.
* To get anywhere in a disagreement, we need to understand they other person's story well enough to see how their conclusions make sense within it.

### Different Stories: Why We Each See the World Differently

We all have different stories about the world because we each take in different information and then intepret this information in our own unique ways.

1. We have different information
   * As each of us proceeds through life, we end up noticing some things are ignoring others
   * What we choose to notice and ignore will be different
   * We each have access to different information
   * What we notice had to do with who we are and what we care about
   * Others have access to information about themselves that we don't
2. We have different intepretations
   * Two especially important factors in how we interpret information:
     * Our past experiences
       * Every strong view we have is profoundly influenced by our past experiences
       * What we've observed in our own family
       * What we've learned throughout our life
       * Often we aren't aware of how these experiences affect our intepretation of the world.  We simply believe that this is the way things are.
     * The implicit rules we've learned about how things should and should not be done
       * Our past experiences often develop into "rules" by which we live our lives.
       * Whether we are aware of them or not, we all follow such rules, and they have a significant influence on the story we tell about what is happenening between us in a difficult conversation
         * When we are are in conflict, it helps to make our rules explicit, and encourage the other person to do the same, this greatly reduces the chance we will be caught in an accidental duel of conflicting rules
3. Our conclusions reflect self-interest
   * Our conclusions are partisan, they often reflect self-interest
   * We look for information to support our view and give that information the most favorable interpretation
     * Then we feel even more certain that our view is right
   * Our self-serving perceptions focus more on things that are consistent with what we want to believe and tend to ignore, explain away, and soon forget those which aren't
     * This tendency to develop unconcious biased perceptions is very human, and can be dangerous.  It calls for a dose of humility about the "rightness" of our story, especially when we have something important at stake

### Move from Certainty to Curiosity

There's only one way to come to understand the other person's story, and that's by being curious.  Certainty locks us out of their story; curiosity lets us in.

#### What's Our Story?

One way to shift our stance from easy certainty of feeling that we've thought about this from every possible angle is to get curious about what we don't know about ourself.
* The process by which we construct our stories about the world often happens so fast, and so automatically, that we are not even aware of all that influences our views

### Embrace Both Stories: Adopt the "And Stance"

It can be awefully hard to stay curious about another person's story when we have our own story to tell, especially if we're thinking that only one story can really be right.
* Part of the stress of staying curious can be relieved by adopting what we call the "And Stance."
  * Don't choose between the stories; embrace both.  That's the "And Stance."
  * Don't worry about accepting or rejecting the other person's story.
    * First work to understand it.  The mere act of understanding someone else's story doesn't require you to give up your own.
  * The "And Stance" is based on the assumption that the world is complex.
    * It gives us a place from which we can assert the full strength of our views and feelings without having to diminish the views and feelings of someone else
    * Beause we may have different information of different intepretations, both stories can make sense at the same time
    * The most useful question is not "Who's right?" but "Now that we really understand each other, what's a good way to manage this problem?"

#### To Move Forward, First Understand Where We Are

Wherever we want to go, understanding - imagining ourself in the other person's story - has got to be our first step.  Before we can figure out how to move forward, we need to understand where we are.

## Don't Assume They Meant It: Disentangle Intent from Impact

**‚≠êÔ∏è Intentions strongly influence our judgements of others.**

### Two Key Mistakes

#### The First Mistake: Our Assumptions About Intentions Are Often Wrong

Here's the problem: while we care deeply about other people's intentions toward us, we don't actually know what their intentions are.  We can't.  Other people's intentions exist only in their hearts and minds.  They are invisible to us.  However real and right our assumptions about other people's intentions may seem to us, they are often incomplete or just plain wrong.

##### We Assume Intentions from the Impact on Us

Our thinking is so automatic that we aren't even aware that our conclusion is only an assumption.  We are so taken in by our story about what they intended that we can't imagine how they could have intended anything else.  When we've been hurt by someone else's behavior, we assume the worst.

We attribute intentions to others all the time.  We often have to read between the lines to figure out what people really mean.

When we are acting, we know that much of the time we don't intend to annoy, offend, or upstage others.  We're wrapped up in our own worries, and are often unaware that we're having any negative impact on others.  When we're the ones acted upon, however, our story too easily slides into one about bad intentions and bad character.  Without hearing from the other person, we can't really know their intentions.

##### We Assume Bad Intentions Mean Bad Character

We easily jump from "They had bad intentions" to "they are a bad person."  We settle into judgements about their character that color our view of them and, indeed, affect not only any conversation we might have, but the entire relationship.  The worse our view of the other person's character, the easier it is to justify avoiding them or saying nasty things behind their back.

Our conclusions are often based solely on the impact of other's behavior on us, which is not a sufficient basis to be sure of someone else's intentions or character.

##### Accusing Them of Bad Intentions Creates Defensiveness

Given how frequently our assumptions are incomplete or wrong, the other person often feels not just accused, but falsely accused.  Few things are more aggravating.
* We should not be surprised that they try to defend themselves, or attack back
* The result is a mess.  No one learns anything, no one apologizes, nothing changes

**Two classical characteristics of the cycle which get well-intentioned people in trouble:**
1. Both parties think they are the victim
2. Both parties think they are acting only to defend themselves

##### Attributions Can Become Self-Fulfilling

When we think others have bad intentions toward us, if affects our behavior.  And, in turn, how we behave affects how they treat us.  Before we know it, our assumption that they have bad intentions towards us has come true.

#### The Second Mistake: Good Intentions Don't Sanitize Bad Impact

A literal focus on intentions ends up clouding the conversation.  Often we say "You intended to hurt me" when what we really mean is "You don't care enough about me."  Thi is an important distinction.
* Most of us on the receiving end make little distinction between "He wanted to hurt me" and "He didn't want to hurt me, but he didn't make me a priority.  Either way, it hurts.
* It is useful to attempt to clarify our intentions.  The question is when.  If we do it at the beginning of the conversation, we are likely doing it without fully understanding what the other person really means to express.

##### We Aggravate Hostility - Especially Between Groups

The desire to sanitize impact is especially commmon in situations involving issues of "difference," like race, gender, or sexual orientation.
* What's important is that whether or not the intention was to exclude, people *felt* excluded.  And such feelings may take time and thought on everyone's part to work through.

### Avoiding the Two Mistakes

Separating impact from intentions requires us to be aware of the automatic leap from "I was hurt" to "You intended to hurt me."  We can make this distinction by asking ourselves 3 questions:

1. **Actions:** "What did the other person actually say or do?"
2. **Impact:** "What was the impact on me?"
3. **Assumption:** "Based on this impact, what assumption am I making about what the other person intended?"

#### Hold Our Views as Hypothesis

Share the impact on us and inquire about their intentions
* We can use our answers to the previous 3 questions to begin the difficult conversation itself
  * Say what the other person did
  * Tell them what its impact on us
  * Explain our assumption about their intentions

#### Don't Pretend We Don't Have a Hypothesis

Recognize our assumptions for what they are: mere guesses subject to modification or disproof.
* When we share our assumptions about their intentions, simply be clear that we are sharing assumptions (guesses) and that we are sharing them for the purpose of testing whether they make sense to the other person

##### Some Defensiveness is Inevitable

It is best to anticipate a certain amount of defensiveness, and to be prepared to clarify what we are trying to communicate and what we are not.
* The more we can relive the other person of the need to defend themselves, the easier it becomes for them to take in what we are saying and to reflect on the complexity of their motivations.

#### Avoiding the Second Mistake: Listen for Feelings and Reflect on Our Intentions

We have a strong tendency to want to defend ourselves, however, starting there leads to trouble.
* If we start by listening and acknowledging the feelings, and then return to the question of intentions, it will make our conversation significantly easier and more constructive.

##### Be Open to Reflecting on the Complexity of Our Intentions

Understanding how we distort other's intentions, making difficult converstations even more difficult, is crucial to untangling what happened to us.
